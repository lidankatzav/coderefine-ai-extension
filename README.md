# Auto Code Improve — VS Code Extension

A lightweight VS Code extension that analyzes the currently opened code file and suggests improvements using a **local LLM**.  
No data is sent to the cloud — all processing happens locally on your machine.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run your local LLM server  
   (e.g., LM Studio → "Start Server" → OpenAI-compatible endpoint enabled).

2. Open any code file in VS Code.

3. Click the **“Suggest Improvements”** button in the editor toolbar  
   **or** run from Command Palette: Auto Code Improve: Suggest Improvements

4. Suggestions will open in a new tab.
